# Progress

## âœ… What Works

### Core Features
- **Session Management**: Full session lifecycle with configurable duration (1-120 minutes)
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API integration with background loops, TTS ducking, and procedural sounds
- **TTS Voice Control**: Customizable voice selection, pitch, and rate with browser voice detection
- **Quote System**: Smart quote selection with persona filtering, intensity levels, and repetition prevention
- **Background Audio**: Multiple presets (waves, rain, birds, pink noise) with real-time volume control
- **Serendipity System**: Dynamic ambient effects (wave crashes, rain droplets, bird chirps) controlled by slider
- **Settings Persistence**: All user preferences saved to localStorage
- **PWA Support**: Offline-first capabilities with service worker

### Visual System (Phase 2 Complete)
- **GPU-Accelerated Visuals**: WebGL/WebGL2 integration with OGL library
- **Procedural Graphics**: Dynamic visual patterns synchronized with audio
- **Scene Management**: Automatic scene transitions with manual controls
- **Audio-Visual Integration**: Visuals respond to audio levels and serendipity settings
- **Performance Optimization**: Dynamic DPR scaling and fallback detection

### Visual Scenes
- **Marbling Scene**: Organic, flowing patterns with audio-reactive distortion
- **Soft-Body Blobs**: Morphing shapes synchronized with breathing cycles
- **Flowing Particles**: Mesmerizing flowing particle systems with organic movement and rich colors

### Quote System (Phase 1 Complete)
- **Enhanced Quote Catalog**: 70+ quotes across 4 personas (student, working adult, creator, universal)
- **Smart Selection**: QuoteManager class with intelligent filtering and repetition prevention
- **Automatic Playback**: Quotes play automatically every 35Â±10 seconds with proper timing
- **Persona Filtering**: Quotes filtered by user's selected persona
- **Intensity Levels**: 0-4 scale for roast intensity
- **Profanity Control**: Three levels (off, medium, strict) for content filtering
- **Session Management**: Quotes reset between sessions, prevent repetition within session

### Audio Features
- **Background Volume**: Real-time volume control during sessions
- **Serendipity Effects**: Random ambient sounds (wave crashes, rain droplets, bird chirps, bandpass effects)
- **TTS Integration**: Speech synthesis with voice customization
- **Audio Ducking**: Background audio lowers when TTS speaks

### Simplified Breathing Pacer System (Phase 3 - Streamlined)
- **Audio-Only Approach**: Removed complex visual animations in favor of reliable audio guidance
- **11 Breathing Patterns**: Organized by categories (Relaxation, Energy, Focus, Sleep, Stress Relief)
  - Box Breathing, 4-7-8, Calm Breathing, Energy Breathing, Power Breathing, Focus Breathing, Mindful Breathing, Sleep Breathing, Deep Sleep, Stress Relief, Anxiety Relief
- **Enhanced Audio System**: Voice guidance, ambient sounds, nature sounds, improved frequency mapping
- **Clean UI**: Simplified interface focusing on pattern selection and audio controls
- **Voice Guidance**: Web Speech API integration with calming voice prompts
- **Ambient Sounds**: Phase-specific sounds and nature-inspired audio effects

## ðŸš§ What's Left to Build

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Custom Pattern Creation**: Allow users to create their own breathing patterns
- **Audio Settings Panel**: Volume controls and sound type selection for breathing audio
- **Animation Preview**: Live preview of breathing animations before starting
- **Session Analytics**: Track usage patterns and preferences
- **Custom Quote Import**: Allow users to add their own quotes
- **Advanced Audio**: More ambient presets and custom audio upload
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Scene Editor**: Allow users to customize visual parameters
- **Export/Import Settings**: Share and backup user configurations

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS and memory usage tracking
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch controls and mobile-specific UI
- **Offline Mode**: Enhanced offline capabilities with cached assets
- **Social Features**: Share sessions and achievements
- **Advanced Visuals**: More complex shader effects and animations

## ðŸ”§ Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- **Linter Warnings**: Some TypeScript null-check warnings (non-blocking)
- **Voice Selector**: Minor accessibility warning for form labels
- **Breathing Pacer**: Svelte reactivity warnings for phase/progress variables

### Resolved Issues
- âœ… **Quote Playback**: Fixed initial delay timing (was 26+ seconds, now 5-10 seconds)
- âœ… **Background Volume**: Fixed real-time volume control during sessions
- âœ… **Serendipity**: Implemented dynamic ambient effects control
- âœ… **TTS Voice Control**: Added comprehensive voice customization
- âœ… **Quote System**: Enhanced with smart selection and repetition prevention
- âœ… **Breathing Pacer**: Simplified to audio-only approach with 11 patterns, voice guidance, and clean UI

## ðŸ“ˆ Evolution of Decisions

### Technical Architecture
- **SvelteKit**: Chosen for client-side PWA with excellent developer experience
- **Web Audio API**: Selected for real-time audio processing and TTS integration
- **QuoteManager Class**: Introduced to centralize quote logic and prevent repetition
- **Procedural Audio**: Preferred over static files to avoid licensing issues
- **Audio-First Approach**: Simplified breathing pacer to focus on reliable audio guidance

### User Experience
- **Voice Customization**: Added comprehensive TTS controls based on user feedback
- **Duration Range**: Extended from 1-10 minutes to 1-120 minutes for longer sessions
- **Serendipity**: Implemented as dynamic ambient effects rather than static sounds
- **Real-time Controls**: Added volume slider during sessions for immediate feedback
- **Breathing Patterns**: Organized by categories for easier discovery and selection
- **Visual Animations**: Multiple sophisticated animation styles for different preferences

### Performance
- **Quote Caching**: Smart filtering and repetition prevention for optimal performance
- **Audio Optimization**: Procedural generation avoids large audio file downloads
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio contexts and timeouts
- **Shader Optimization**: Efficient GLSL shaders with smooth transitions
