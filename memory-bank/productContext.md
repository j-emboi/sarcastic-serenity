# Product Context

## Why this exists
People want a quick, lighthearted break that feels calming but also pokes fun at their stress. The app helps users decompress with ambience, humor, and satisfying visuals.

## Users
- Students (exam crunch, deadlines)
- Working adults (back-to-back meetings, burnout)
- Creators (creative block, procrastination)

## Experience goals
- Funny, calming, slightly infuriating (in a playful way)
- Fast setup; two-tap “Quick Start” after first use
- Reliable offline behavior and fast performance

## How it should work
- User configures a session (duration, persona, roast intensity, background, scenes, serendipity, breathing pacer, profanity level).
- During the session: background loops play, quotes appear on-screen and are spoken via TTS, visuals loop/morph, optional breathing pacer guides rhythm.
- User can pause/resume, skip quotes, and switch scenes without jank.

## Content
- Quotes: 150–300 sarcastic/edgy lines tagged by persona, intensity, and topic. Default to unsafe content for the preview, with a prominent profanity toggle.
- Audio: 6–10 CC0 loops; small set of ambient SFX for rare sprinkles.
- Visuals: GPU-first shader scenes with adaptive quality and fallbacks.

## Non-goals (MVP)
- Accounts, cloud sync, analytics, community/social features.
- Paid TTS or online dependencies (kept as optional upgrades only).
